Building Erlang

Make sure to have a valid toolchain in your path, in the EmbErl.sh script there
is a variable named host. The toolchain should have it's binaries named
$(HOST)-command. Example for HOST = arm gcc should be arm-gcc and be available
in your path.

We have used the toolchain that is built by openembedded when building our things.

./EmbErl.sh -<opts> 

Available opts are:
-s          Strip beam files and compile with the slim flag
-S          Stip binaries with the strip-tool
-c          Compile beams using the compress flag
-C          Compress applications into zip's
-o <arg>    Compile the virtual machine with the <arg> optimization flag
-H <arg>    Compile the virtual machine for the host <arg>
-h          Display help message 

To change version that EmbErl.sh builds change the VERSION variable in the script.
