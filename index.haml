          Erlang-embedded is a platform for developing embedded Erlang
          applications. The project started as a collection of thesis
          projects at Uppsala University, under the supervision of
          [Erlang Solutions](http://www.erlang-solutions.com).

          Our goal is to provide developers with an operating system
          distribution and an Erlang release, ready to be installed on
          an embedded device to reduce the time needed to setup a
          development environment.

          The easiest way to get started is to visit the
          [getting started](start.html) page.
