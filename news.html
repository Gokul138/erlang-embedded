          Lucanus cervus is the best-known species of stag beetle (family Lucanidae),
          and is sometimes referred to simply as the stag beetle. It is the largest
          beetle in Europe. It lives in holes in old trees and dead trunks, in the forest
          as well as in groves. Forest management, in eliminating old trees and
          deadwood, eliminates at the same time the habitat and food of this species.
          Once quite common, the population of the Lucanus cervus, along with that of
          other species of beetles which feed on wood, is in steep decline, and has been
          listed globaly as a threatened species. In Sweden the stag beetle is known as
          Ekoxe and is the province animal of Blekinge one of Swedens 25 provinces.
