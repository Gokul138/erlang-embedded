Females are generally bear a single pup, which they care for alone. Pups are able to swim and dive within hours of birth and they develop quickly. A fatty tissue layer called blubber is present under their skins and helps to maintain body temperature.</p>

          <h3>First release of the distribution today!</h3>
          <p>Today we release the first version of Erlang-embedded, dubbed &#8220;stag beetle&#8221;. We look forward to hearing what the community thinks about it. Get it <a href='downloads.html'>here</a>, try it out, and tell us what you think!</p>

            <p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucanus_cervus'>Lucanus cervus</a> is the best-known species of stag beetle (family Lucanidae), and is sometimes referred to simply as the stag beetle. It is the largest beetle in Europe. It lives in holes in old trees and dead trunks, in the forest as well as in groves. Forest management, in eliminating old trees and deadwood, eliminates at the same time the habitat and food of this species. Once quite common, the population of the Lucanus cervus, along with that of other species of beetles which feed on wood, is in steep decline, and has been listed globaly as a threatened species. In Sweden the stag beetle is known as Ekoxe and is the province animal of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blekinge'>Blekinge</a>, one of 25 provinces in Sweden.</p>
