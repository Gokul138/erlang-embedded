            <p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucanus_cervus'>Lucanus cervus</a> is the best-known species of stag beetle (family Lucanidae), and is sometimes referred to simply as the stag beetle. It is the largest beetle in Europe. It lives in holes in old trees and dead trunks, in the forest as well as in groves. Forest management, in eliminating old trees and deadwood, eliminates at the same time the habitat and food of this species. Once quite common, the population of the Lucanus cervus, along with that of other species of beetles which feed on wood, is in steep decline, and has been listed globaly as a threatened species. In Sweden the stag beetle is known as Ekoxe and is the province animal of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blekinge'>Blekinge</a>, one of 25 provinces in Sweden.</p>
