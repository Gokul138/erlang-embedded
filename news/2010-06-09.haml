  Lucanus cervus is the best-known species of stag beetle (family Lucanidae),
  and is sometimes referred to simply as the stag beetle. It is the largest
  beetle in Europe. It lives in holes in old trees and dead trunks, in the forest
  as well as in groves. Forest management, in eliminating old trees and
  deadwood, eliminates at the same time the habitat and food of this species.
  Once quite common, the population of the Lucanus cervus, along with that of
  other species of beetles which feed on wood, is in steep decline, and has been
  listed globaly as a threatened species. In Sweden the stag beetle is known as
  Ekoxe and is the province animal of Blekinge one of Swedens 25 provinces.
