    [Lucanus cervus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucanus_cervus) is
    the best-known species of stag beetle (family Lucanidae), and is
    sometimes referred to simply as the stag beetle. It is the largest
    beetle in Europe. It lives in holes in old trees and dead trunks,
    in the forest as well as in groves. Forest management, in
    eliminating old trees and deadwood, eliminates at the same time
    the habitat and food of this species. Once quite common, the
    population of the Lucanus cervus, along with that of other species
    of beetles which feed on wood, is in steep decline, and has been
    listed globaly as a threatened species. In Sweden the stag beetle
    is known as Ekoxe and is the province animal of
    [Blekinge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blekinge), one of 25
    provinces in Sweden.
